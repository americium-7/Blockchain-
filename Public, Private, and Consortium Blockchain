Here is a **simple and clean table** showing the **Differences between Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchain** — perfect for exam writing.

# **Difference Between Public, Private, and Consortium Blockchain**

| **Feature**      | **Public Blockchain**                    | **Private Blockchain**               | **Consortium Blockchain**                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Access**       | Open to everyone                         | Only selected users                  | Controlled by a group of organizations        |
| **Control**      | No single owner (fully decentralized)    | One central organization controls it | Shared control between multiple organizations |
| **Transparency** | Fully transparent                        | Limited transparency                 | Partially transparent                         |
| **Speed**        | Slower (many users validate)             | Faster (fewer users)                 | Faster than public, slower than private       |
| **Security**     | Very secure but vulnerable to 51% attack | Highly secure internally             | Secure due to multiple trusted parties        |
| **Examples**     | Bitcoin, Ethereum                        | Hyperledger, Ripple                  | Banking consortiums, Supply chain networks    |
| **Use Cases**    | Cryptocurrency, open networks            | Internal company operations          | Banking, supply chain, multi-company projects |

If you want, I can also give **short notes** or **3–5 mark paragraphs** for each type.
