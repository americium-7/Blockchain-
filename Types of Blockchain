1. Public Blockchain

A public blockchain is open for everyone.
Anyone can join, read data, and add new transactions.
It is fully decentralized and transparent.

Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum

Easy words:
Anyone can join and see everything.

2. Private Blockchain

A private blockchain is controlled by one organization.
Only selected users are allowed to join and access data.
It is not fully decentralized but is faster and more secure for internal use.

Examples: Hyperledger, Ripple (used in banks)

Easy words:
Only invited people can use it.

3. Consortium (Federated) Blockchain

A consortium blockchain is managed by a group of organizations instead of one.
Multiple trusted members share control and maintain the network.
It is more secure and balanced than a private blockchain.

Examples: Banking groups, supply chain companies

Easy words:
A group of companies control the blockchain together.
